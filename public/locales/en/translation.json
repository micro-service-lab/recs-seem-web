When I do personal development, I often do the front end (react) as well, so I should be able to do that to some extent (I have no problem writing logic, but I can't design at all, so I tend to use templates). \nI have never touched the Ôºån embedded system at all, and I am interested in touching the parts close to the hardware, but I have not been able to touch it yet because I do not have enough knowledge of electric and logic circuits. \nI also have no experience with Java, and have only touched Java at the level of a university lecture, and have not been able to do it because it is difficult to do it on my own. \nI am currently involved in the development of ﬂãn applications (especially native application development), but I can't say that I have much development experience since I have basically only touched the api server side. I would like to learn how to use rust (tauri) for desktop development in the future.",
    "skill-infrastructure-description": "I have only studied a little about infrastructure for development. However, I use Linux (ubuntu) as my main OS and have built several servers locally without using dokcer, so I have a little knowledge of servers. I have learned about networking and security several times through books and videos, but I have not been able to do much practical work. As for databases, I have some knowledge and experience in table design and SQL and beyond, but I have not studied indexing and normalization from scratch in reference books, so I would like to learn from scratch when I have time. I have also learned about the \n cloud, but in fact, due to financial problems, I have not been able to get my hands on it as an individual. However, I plan to publish this site on AWS, and I would like to actively use relatively inexpensive services such as S3 in the future.",
    "skill-others-description": "There are many areas that I have not been able to get a handle on outside of development and infrastructure, and I have very little knowledge of test code, design, or development methodology. I am very interested in learning test code, which I aim to learn concurrently with learning RUST, and design. I have no communication skills at all, so I will be working on this and English, which I have barely studied since high school. Recently, I have been given a great opportunity to attend meetings with the front desk staff of another company, so my goal is to improve my ability to explain things in a concise manner. In addition to that, I would like to attend various conferences and other opportunities to connect with others (if you have any recommendations, I would love to hear them üôè ). I have a vague knowledge of software design, but no definite knowledge. I feel like I spend the most time on anything, whether it's table design or application design (I worry too much)...",
